        <comment>MagneticData provides information about the magnetic parameters
 in a location defined by its Latitude, Longitude and Altitude coordinates.
 Methods: 
 
 Initialize - initializes the object by reading parameters from a file.
 The file “WMMC.COF” must be located at the directory "Magnetics" under the "Root external" Dir.
 The file is valid for the period 2010 - 2015.
 For later use a new file should be prepared from data found in this site:
 http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml ,
 where the algorithm is taken from.
 
  MAGNETICDATA (LAT As Double, LON As Double, ALT As Double) As String[] 
  Lat and LON are in degrees, East and North positive. 
  Alt in Km above sea level or the WGS84 ellipsoid.
  The method returns an array of three parameters: 
  -Magnetic Declination (or Variation) 
  -Magnetic Inclination 
  -Grid Variation - for Lat above 55 degrees or below -55 degrees.
   For other cases it returns -999.
   
   SETDATE (Day As Int, Month As Int, Year As Int) 
   The library is taking today's date as a default. 
   If you need calculation for another date - use this method.</comment>
