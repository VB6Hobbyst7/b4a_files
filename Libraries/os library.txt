This 'giant' library has around 60+ commands.
 Everything is explained in the library itself.
 
What does it cover:
 
- Memory size of directories
 - Tons of hardware strings (e.g model, device, host, ...)
 - A unique, very easy countdown timer with 2 events (easier than timer 

CPU information
 - Running services, tasks, sending signals
 - Rebooting (and wiping data)
 - and a lot more!

 
 
Code:

Dim OS As OperatingSystem
OS.Initialize("OS")
OS.CountDownTimer(1000)

Sub OS_ontick (ms as long)       
toastmessageshow(ms,false)end sub

Sub OS_onfinish (OS As String)    
Msgbox(OS,"OS Library") 'get the secret message in here ;)

End Sub
