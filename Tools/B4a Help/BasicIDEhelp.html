<br>
Get the available height of the window.<br>

ACTIVITY FUNCTIONS<br>
<br>
Returns true if this is the first time the initial code block program has been run.<br>
This is the equivalent of FirstTime in Activity_Create.<br>

SetSavedData(dataarrayname As String)<br>
<br>
Close the Activity and return to the editor<br>
Call this at the end of the initial code block for a program that does not support events otherwise the<br>
program will be left waiting for an event that won't come and the back button will be needed to close it.<br>
A program that does support events can end by calling AppClose or this.<br>
ActivityFinish<br>
<br>
Set the Background property of the Activity to the GradientDrawable.<br>
Returns false if less than two colors are in the array otherwise returns true.<br>
Orientation can be one of the following - <br>
"TOP_BOTTOM", "TR_BL" (Top-Right To Bottom-Left, "RIGHT_LEFT", "BR_TL" (Bottom-Right To Top-Left)<br>
"BOTTOM_TOP", "BL_TR" (Bottom-Left To Top-Right), "LEFT_RIGHT", "TL_BR" (Top-Left To Bottom-Right)<br>
SetActivityBackground(orientation As String, radius As String, colorsarrayname As String)<br>
<br>
Logs the provided message to the Logcat output.<br>
LogCat(message As String)<br>
<br>
 Closes the Activity menu. This is added for symmetry with OpenMenu but seems of little practical use.<br>
CloseMenu<br>
<br>
